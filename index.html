            <p>Hello I am Kenneth Cortez, I am from a city called Sonsonate in the country of El Salvador in Central America. I'm 21 years old and I'm currently home schooling through the BYU program. I currently work full time at FamilySearch here in El Salvador with different tasks, such as computer support and other internal processes of the organization. I serve as a volunteer within the church, within my ward I have been called to lead the missionary work and also support the bishop as his secretary. Some of my hobbies are that I love to play basketball even with a bad knee, I like to listen to music, especially electronic music, and I like to spend time with my family.</p>

            <p>This is the 'Pupusa' El Salvador's most traditional food, it is the classic dish that everyone can enjoy when visiting our beautiful country.</p>
            <p>El Salvador is a country located in the center of the American continent, next to Guatemala and Honduras.
                It is the smallest country in Central America but it is the one with the kindest people I have ever met.</p>
